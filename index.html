  <p>I was born in a little town by accident, and by accident I mean that
    it just happened to be the town where my dad was making a construction,
    both my parents are arquitects. So thats how Im the only member of all
    my family that belongs to this tiny town known by some ancient Mommies and
    delicious strawberries, the name of the state is Guanajuato, in native
    language means Mountain frogs; but well I didnt really lived there
    more than my fist year of life, until few years ago I had the magical
    pleasure to explore this city and completely fall in love with it,
    I could even do some Mountain bike with some locals. </p>
